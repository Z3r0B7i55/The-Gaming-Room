# The-Gaming-Room

The client The Gaming Room currently had a project in development "Draw-it or Lose-it". They just wanted to improve upon the design of the game and examine the requirements to develop on other platforms. 

Outlining the security measures that would need to be taken for each platform, for each level of the project. This required a double take but after further examination of the project, I was able to determine that server security could in theory be minimized in order to maximize deliverables to the user in the form of an operating program which would be cloud based. However, more traditional means would of course need to be more secure for the fact that the data would need to be stored server side. 

The design document was there to aid in carefully documenting the features and what would need to be designed in order for the scope of the project to maintain its form. When questions were being asked about the project in terms of security or what would be required for specific instances, this would generally be well documented, which would aid in the overall design. 

I would like to improve upon the medium for which the game would intially be developed. If the game had more room for growth in a PC environment, then there would be a possiblity to consider using API's free from Steam and even Google Play on mobile devices. If more could be added to the game, to add on to the intial scope of the project, it could make branching out and using API's tailored toward that type of development. Allowing for reductions in the need for security or even cloud based support. 

By closely paying atention to the documents provided by The Gaming Room, I was able to understand and decisvely work out a document for captioning the user's requirements for Draw-it or Lose-it. The user must come first and any personal beliefs must be ignored. The user's requirements must be met, or we risk scope fringe and even a complete lose of interest and funding. 

Generally when designing a new piece of software it would be wise to maintain a close relationship with the client. Calling the client and even having a conference call with all parties involved would be wise to have a clear consise stream of information which everyone would be made aware of in the development process. So that when developing the piece of software, everyone would be made aware of upcoming changes and even updates to the scope if there need to be any.
